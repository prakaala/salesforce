## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used the website www.w3schools.com to brush up some of css skills. I relied on mdn docs as well to understand the concepts behind the functions used in the game. I also read from javascript.info where I could browse onto different topics. I learned about callback function and async functions. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
It was smooth till creating html page, and even css page. I had a bit difficulty in understanding how setTimeOut works, and how could I implement that to run the game. I was initially thinking to run two loops inside the other, but by using setTimeOut, the game logic was easily developed. Moreover, I had one question regarding the clicking of right and left button. When I clicked the right button, there was an indefinite period of play of the button. It would go out after clicking the right button. I also changed the number of image displayed on each button when computer plays and when the user clicks. It was enjoyful to watch.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I wanted to learn how more than two people collaborate on a single project. Moreover, I also want to learn about the blockchain technology on web. I want to know how to handle the users input and store them in server. I would want to learn how to create a responsive website, so that the website works on every devices. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely add the 3 strikes per game. I would also try to make the website more responsive. Moreover, I would also have added the score counter on the screen. I would also have used arrow functions to make code look more simpler. I would also have added a different music using audio tag.
